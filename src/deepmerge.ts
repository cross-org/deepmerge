/**
 * @fileoverview This module provides a versatile deep object merging function (deepMerge)
 *               that works consistently across Deno, Bun, and Node.js. It offers
 *               customizable array merging strategies.
 */

/**
 * Optional options interface to control the deep merge process.
 *
 * * **`arrayMergeStrategy`**
 *     * **"combine"**: (default behavior) Appends arrays, preserving duplicates.
 *     * **"unique"**: Creates an array with only unique elements.
 *     * **"replace"**: Substitutes the target array entirely with the source array.
 *
 * * **`setMergeStrategy`**
 *     * **"combine"**: (default behavior) Adds new members to the target Set.
 *     * **"replace"**: Overwrites the target Set with the source Set.
 *
 * * **`mapMergeStrategy`**
 *     * **"combine"**: (default behavior) Merges with the source Map, replacing values for matching keys.
 *     * **"replace"**: Overwrites the target Map with the source Map.
 *
 * * **`dateMergeStrategy`**
 *     * **"replace"**: (default behavior) Overwrites the target Date with the source Date.
 *     * **"keepEarlier"**: Keeps the earlier Date
 *     * **"keepLater"**: Keeps the later Date
 *
 * * **`customMergeFunctions`**
 *     * Allows specifying custom merge functions for handling specific types or structures during the merge process.
 *     * Each key in this object corresponds to the constructor name of the value to be merged.
 *     * The function assigned to each key is used to merge values of that type.
 *     * **Key**: The constructor name of the values to be merged (e.g., "Date").
 *     * **Value**: A function that takes two parameters (`targetVal`, `sourceVal`) and returns the merged result.
 *     * Example:
 *         ```typescript
 *         {
 *             Date: (targetVal, sourceVal) => {
 *                 return targetVal < sourceVal ? targetVal : sourceVal;
 *             },
 *             Array: (targetArr, sourceArr) => {
 *                 if (!Array.isArray(targetArr)) {
 *                     targetArr = [];
 *                 }
 *                 if (!Array.isArray(sourceArr)) {
 *                     sourceArr = [];
 *                 }
 *                 return [...new Set([...targetArr, ...sourceArr])];
 *             }
 *         }
 *         ```
